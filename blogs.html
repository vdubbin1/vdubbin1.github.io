                      <h4>What is it?</h4>
                      <p>Unlike regular crime, Cyber Crime is often stealth and affects both individuals and businesses alike. As a general rule, cyber crime is committed for either financial gain or with intent to cause disruption to a business, group or network.</p>
                      <p>Types of Cyber Crime include:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Ransomware attacks</li>
                        <li>password decryption</li>
                        <li>BEC (Business Email Compromise)</li>
                        <li>Hacking - including DDoS(distributed denial-of-service) attacks.</li>
                        <li>malware attacks - including viruses, worms, trojans, spyware.</li>
                        <li>cyber fraud - including phishing, spear phishing, fishing and whaling.</li>
                      </ul>

			<p><h4><b>Who is responsible?</b></h4></p>
			<p>Well, there are three tiers of responsibility. At level one, we are all responsible. For example, how many of us actually read the cookies pops that we see on virtually every website we visit nowadays? Do we really know what we just clicked ‘Accept’ to? We are all aware of the of the risks presented by modern technology. With passwords being required more and more, it is essential we become more aware of the impact of Cyber Crime and are personally accountable for 1st line defence of our data by creating worthy passwords. </p>

			<p>At the second level, under GDPR legislation, by issuing your data to a business entity, they are bound by duty to have systems in place to protect your data against breaches. Companies that are not investing a significant budget towards cyber security and data protection are left exposed to risk and at some point, those vulnerabilities will be exploited. As well as the cost of potential downtime, lost data and financial penalties, the greater price to pay is loss of reputation.</p>

			<p>Finally, the third level are the Cyber Criminals themselves. Cyber Crime is never a victimless crime despite it being carried out remotely. Often these Black Hat Hackers are part of either state-sponsored groups, hacking groups or individuals experimenting. Unlike White Hat hackers, Black Hats don’t abide by any moral code or ethics and their activity is illegal.</p>
			<p>By using ‘Off the shelf’ VPN software, attackers can remain anonymous and are seldom caught unless through complacency or by association with convicted hackers.</p>

			<p><h4><b>But why?</b></h4></p>
			<p>Illegal hackers rarely spare a thought for the victim. Often, the motivation for the attack is down to financial gain, power, control or anonymous recognition , for example being discussed in the media. With 4 out of 5 adults using some form of online banking, it’s clear that the opportunity is constantly growing for the cyber opportunists and by more money becoming digitalised through Cryptocurrencies, it becomes easier for criminals to move money anonymously.</p>

			<p><h4><b>Where they hide…</b></h4></p>
			<p>The popular ‘playground’ for online criminals is within The Dark Web, also known as The Dark Net. Unsurprisingly, the dark web is a host to a multitude of criminal websites, marketplaces and networks. As the dark web is accessible simply by downloading specific software, it does pose a threat to any tech savvy, impressionable people out there. Given that all traffic visiting the dark web is anonymised, catching the perpetrators using it for criminal activity is an ongoing challenge which hopefully with a constant flow of new talent entering the cyber security industry will someday be overcome.</p>

			<p>Before venturing somewhere new, I have no doubt that most people would use some form of mapping to get there, be that either Sat nav or old school physical maps. Nmap is no different. It helps us get a picture of the landscape we wish to work with by telling us what services are running on on which ports. We call this process ‘port scanning’.</p>

			<p>A computer uses ports when establishing connections to manage the data and keep it separate. There are two ports in use per one connection. One would be the randomly selected port being used on your local machine and the other would be the open port listening on the remote server(where you want to communicate to). With a total of 65535 ports available on every computer there are plenty of ports available however, without any kind of port scanning, manually checking these ports would take an age.</p>

			<p>Many ports ore pre-determined, for example port 80 for HTTP or port 443 for HTTPS. However, that is not to say that these standard ports could not be altered. This reinforces the requirement to carry out port scanning. </p>

			<p>The role of the Nmap tool is to connect to each port in turn to determine if each port is open, closed or filtered(behind a firewall). Obviously, if our objective were to carry out an attack as part of an audit for example, using a tool like nmap to find an open port is invaluable.  </p>

			<p>With modes like ‘Aggressive’ & the ability to select the speed, individual port selection or port range selection on Nmap, you have full control over every aspect of the scanning. You can go even further by extending the functionality and versatility of Nmap significantly by using NSE(Nmap Scripting Engine). The NSE has an extensive library to expand the functionality of Nmap and includes categories such as : Safe, Exploit and Brute(won’t effect target, attempt to exploit a vulnerability, attempt to brute force credentials for running services - respectively).</p>

			<p>To install Nmap, use the command <sudo apt update && sudo apt install nmap>. The list of commands available in Nmap can be found by typing <man nmap> into your terminal. </p>

                        <h3><a href="#">OSI Model</a></h3>
                        <p>Here is a summary of the OSI model</p>
                        <ul class="meta">
                          <li class="icon fa-clock">15 minutes ago</li>

                      <p>
			<p>Here I have broken down the OSI model into my own terms to help me understand it and hopefully help others too.</p>

			<p>Each level of the OSI model is outlined below. With layer number represents where it sits in the hierarchy(level 7 being the first) and in brackets I’ve stated where the layer gets implemented.</p>

			<p>Layer 7 - Application (Software)</p>
			<p>The Application layer is the network layer for applications to use to transmit data. Data passed to this layer is then passed down into the next layer in the model, the Presentation layer. In practical use, this would be HTTP(Hypertext Transfer Protocol) for example.</p>

			<p>Layer 6 - Presentation (Software)</p>
			<p>This layer translates the data into a standardised format that can be understood by the application layer in the receiving computer. In addition, this layer handles any encryption, compression or other transformations of the data. The data is then passed on to the next layer in the process, the Session layer.</p>
			      
			<p>Layer 5 - Session (Software)</p>
			<p>Once the Application and Presentation layers have passed the processed data to the Session layer, this layer checks to see if it is able to establish a connection with the other	computer over the network. When a successful connection is established, this layer maintains that connection as-well as engaging with the remote computer to continue to synchronise the data between the two. This layer can create multiple requests to multiple endpoints simultaneously whilst keeping the data separated and clean. If a connection cannot be established, then an error message would be returned and the process would go no further. With the session(connection between the host and the remote computer) established, the data is now passed to the Transport layer.</p>

			<p>Layer 4 - Transport (joins the Software and Hardware levels)
			The Transport layer must select which protocol is best served to transmit your data. Using TCP(Transmission Control Protocol), a connection is established and maintained for the duration of this instance of request. Alternatively, where speedy connection is a higher priority than a quality connection, then UDP(User Datagram Protocol) could be used. With TCP, the success rate would likely be higher due to the reliability of it’s connection and it being task dependent, for example the packets being delivered correctly and if data is lost, they would be resent until the task is completed successfully and the established connection could then be dropped. Once the Transport layer has selected the most suitable protocol, the data is transmitted in smaller segments(for TCP) or datagrams(for UDP) for a more successful transmission.</p>
			
			<p>Layer 3 - Network (Hardware)</p>
			<p>The Network layer is the ‘cyber sat nav’ for your request. Having received your request from the Transport layer, the Network layer determines the best path to take to process your request quickly and efficiently using ‘Logical addressing’.  The most common for of Logical addresses are in the IPV4 format (IE 192.168.1.1 as a home router address).</p>

			<p>Layer 2 - Data link (Hardware)</p>
			<p>This layer is multifunctional as it checks that the data is in a format suitable for transmission and checks that received data hasn’t become corrupted during transmission. </p>
			<p>In addition, this layer handles the physical addressing using the unique MAC(Media Access Control) from your NIC(Network Interface Card).</p>

			<p>Layer 1 - Physical (Hardware)</p>
			<p>The physical layer can be defined as the actual physical signals triggering or carrying the data. For example, this could be :</p>

				<p>Bluetooth, Ethernet or CAN BUS(Controller Area Network).</p>

			<p>The above steps are the process of sending data from one computer to another(encapsulation). When receiving the data, the process is reversed and the process starts at Layer 1 (Physical) and working through the above steps up to Layer 7 (Application). This receiving process is referred to as de-encapsulation.</p>

			<p>This is my overview of the OSI model from a newbie in the world of Cyber Security. Feel free to add your comments and input.</p>
