                      <h4>What is it?</h4>
                      <p>Unlike regular crime, Cyber Crime is often stealth and affects both individuals and businesses alike. As a general rule, cyber crime is committed for either financial gain or with intent to cause disruption to a business, group or network.</p>
                      <p>Types of Cyber Crime include:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Ransomware attacks</li>
                        <li>password decryption</li>
                        <li>BEC (Business Email Compromise)</li>
                        <li>Hacking - including DDoS(distributed denial-of-service) attacks.</li>
                        <li>malware attacks - including viruses, worms, trojans, spyware.</li>
                        <li>cyber fraud - including phishing, spear phishing, fishing and whaling.</li>
                      </ul>

			<p><h4><b>Who is responsible?</b></h4></p>
			<p>Well, there are three tiers of responsibility. At level one, we are all responsible. For example, how many of us actually read the cookies pops that we see on virtually every website we visit nowadays? Do we really know what we just clicked ‘Accept’ to? We are all aware of the of the risks presented by modern technology. With passwords being required more and more, it is essential we become more aware of the impact of Cyber Crime and are personally accountable for 1st line defence of our data by creating worthy passwords. </p>

			<p>At the second level, under GDPR legislation, by issuing your data to a business entity, they are bound by duty to have systems in place to protect your data against breaches. Companies that are not investing a significant budget towards cyber security and data protection are left exposed to risk and at some point, those vulnerabilities will be exploited. As well as the cost of potential downtime, lost data and financial penalties, the greater price to pay is loss of reputation.</p>

			<p>Finally, the third level are the Cyber Criminals themselves. Cyber Crime is never a victimless crime despite it being carried out remotely. Often these Black Hat Hackers are part of either state-sponsored groups, hacking groups or individuals experimenting. Unlike White Hat hackers, Black Hats don’t abide by any moral code or ethics and their activity is illegal.</p>
			<p>By using ‘Off the shelf’ VPN software, attackers can remain anonymous and are seldom caught unless through complacency or by association with convicted hackers.</p>

			<p><h4><b>But why?</b></h4></p>
			<p>Illegal hackers rarely spare a thought for the victim. Often, the motivation for the attack is down to financial gain, power, control or anonymous recognition , for example being discussed in the media. With 4 out of 5 adults using some form of online banking, it’s clear that the opportunity is constantly growing for the cyber opportunists and by more money becoming digitalised through Cryptocurrencies, it becomes easier for criminals to move money anonymously.</p>

			<p><h4><b>Where they hide…</b></h4></p>
			<p>The popular ‘playground’ for online criminals is within The Dark Web, also known as The Dark Net. Unsurprisingly, the dark web is a host to a multitude of criminal websites, marketplaces and networks. As the dark web is accessible simply by downloading specific software, it does pose a threat to any tech savvy, impressionable people out there. Given that all traffic visiting the dark web is anonymised, catching the perpetrators using it for criminal activity is an ongoing challenge which hopefully with a constant flow of new talent entering the cyber security industry will someday be overcome.</p>
      <p>Thanks for reading.</p>
