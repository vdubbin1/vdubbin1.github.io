        <p>Living in the West of England, making the most of the fantastic tech scene in the West Country thanks to UWE Bristol and the opportunites that I am surrounded by. Check out my latest <a href="blogs.html">Blog</a> posts here to find out what I have been learning about.</p>
        <p>Having spent the majority of my working life in various Management roles, I'd not given any thought as to whether I was suited to anything else or not, it's just the job I did. In 2021, I finally decided I wanted a change and set about looking at incorporating what I am passionate about and how to find work in this field.
		I love Information Technology and exploring new tech and having spent the last 6 month studying Cyber Security and knowing the transferable skills I have from various industries and management experince, I'm really excited to see what the future holds.</p>
