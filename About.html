        <p>Living in the West of England, making the most of the fantastic tech scene in the West Country thanks to UWE Bristol and the opportunites that i am surrounded by. Check out my latest <a href="blogs.html">Blog</a> posts here.</p>
        <p>Having spent the majority of my working life in Management roles, I'd not given anythought as to whether it was my passion or not, it's just what I did. In 2021, I finally decided I wanted a change and set about looking at what I was passionate about and how I could find work in this field.
		and in doing so, I can confirm that if you work in something that you enjoy, you never need to work another day. I love Information Technology and exploring new tech and having spent the last 6 month studying Cyber Security, I'm really excited to see what the future holds.</p>
