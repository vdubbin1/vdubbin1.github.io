			<p>I am a professional Manager based near to Bristol in the West of England. With over 20 years Customer Service experience under my belt I’ve spent a lot of my early career in sales and then moving into Sales, Operations and Account Management in the latter part of my career.</p>

			<p>With multi Industry experience behind me, ranging from B2C in retail to B2B in the Rail industry, Industrial machines sector and white goods. The skills I have learned from these invaluable experiences across these industries can be transposed to any industry and grow in strength each time they are used.</p>

			<p>Now I’m entering the Information Technology industry, I’m really excited to see how and where these transferable skills will make an impact and what the different perspectives I can share in a new industry but more importantly, what new skills I can pick up and use on my journey to becoming an expert in a new field.</p>

			<p>Having managed projects all over the world, I’m no stranger to working across multiple time zones and the challenges this can present however as a solution focussed individual, challenges are what I thrive on. As we all know, the last couple of years have presented us with new challenges in the workplace and being agile, adaptable and a good time manager have been key to continuing to deliver successful results in recent years.</p>

			<p>Sometimes, without looking for it, the opportunity arises where the landscape is right for you to take your passion to the next level and begin training to become an expert in that field. Through a set of unexpected circumstances, this is how I stumbled upon Cyber Security and Web Development. I feel privileged to have found something which both makes me happy and I can build a career in as not everybody gets to feel the joy that this brings.</p>

			<p>I’ve always had an interest in technology and computing since a young age, always keeping up with the latest tech news and following the right channels to slowly develop my skills in the field over the years. However in 2020, I decided I wanted to engage in some training to give me some exposure to some real life working scenarios. From that training, I then enrolled onto the Cyber Security boot camp through the University of the West of England, Bristol. You can find out more about what I learned during my time on the Cyber Bootcamp <a href="blogs.html">here</a>.</p>
